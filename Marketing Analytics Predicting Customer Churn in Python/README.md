# プロジェクト名：Marketing Analytics: Predicting Customer Churn in Python (Datacamp course)

Churn is when a customer stops doing business or ends a relationship with a company. It’s a common problem across a variety of industries, from telecommunications to cable TV to SaaS, and a company that can predict churn can take proactive action to retain valuable customers and get ahead of the competition. This course will provide you a roadmap to create your own customer churn models. You’ll learn how to explore and visualize your data, prepare it for modeling, make predictions using machine learning, and communicate important, actionable insights to stakeholders. By the end of the course, you’ll become comfortable using the **pandas** library for data analysis and the **scikit-learn** library for machine learning.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Begin exploring the Telco Churn Dataset using **pandas** to compute summary statistics and Seaborn to create attractive visualizations.


2. Preprocessing for Churn Modeling
Having explored your data, it's now time to preprocess it and get it ready for machine learning. Learn the why, what, and how of preprocessing, including feature selection and feature engineering.


3. Churn Prediction
With your data preprocessed and ready for machine learning, it's time to predict churn! Learn how to build supervised learning machine models in Python using scikit-learn.

4. Model Tuning
Learn how to improve the performance of your models using hyperparameter tuning and gain a better understanding of the drivers of customer churn that you can take back to the business.
