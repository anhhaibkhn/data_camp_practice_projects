# プロジェクト名：Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

プロジェクト概要：Apply the foundational Python skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data.

- チーム数：1名
- 手順：(Project tasks order)
1. Loading your friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?

- 使用ツール：Python、Jupyter notebook, Pandas
- Topics: Data Manipulation, Data Visualization, Programming.

- 結果： In this project, you’ll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

You’ll also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. Press play to begin!
